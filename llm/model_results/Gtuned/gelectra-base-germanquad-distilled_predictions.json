Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f ( n ) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME ( f ( n ) ).

The first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay, and much of what is now Victoria was included in the Port Phillip District in 1836, an administrative division of New South Wales. Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved self - government in 1855. The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the Federation of Australia in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia. Melbourne also served as capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927, with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne ' s Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne.

A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence.

The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin ( John Calvin ), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence. Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.

Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections ( remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer ), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X. 25 host attachments, gateways to X. 25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP / IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network.

It was founded by former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts as a means of making ARPANET technology public. He had tried to interest AT & T in buying the technology, but the monopoly ' s reaction was that this was incompatible with their future. Bolt, Beranack and Newman ( BBN ) provided the financing. It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X. 25 and the terminal interface to X. 29. Telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the CCITT. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul - Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents : one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance.

At least 60 % of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well.

Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed.

[SEP] In the modern industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts. The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by a design team including Architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is most commonly employed by ( i. e. in contract with ) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor.

In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so - called Anglian glaciation ( ~ 450, 000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12 ), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine ' s course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine. During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas, in what is now the Netherlands.

Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism ' s core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.

[SEP] The concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity. The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year. Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free - falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames. This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free - fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton ' s Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid - air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame.

Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory. : 212 \u2013 219 [SEP] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]", "5ad279e5d7d075001a4295c3": "Isaac Newton", "5ad279e5d7d075001a4295c4": "Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell", "5ad279e5d7d075001a4295c5": "a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces ( all except gravity ) are manifestations of matter ( fermions ) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons", "573784fa1c45671900574483": "Isaac Newton", "573784fa1c45671900574484": "Galileo", "573784fa1c45671900574485": "[PAD]", "573784fa1c45671900574486": "sea level", "573784fa1c45671900574487": "the force of gravity", "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fa": "What we now call gravity", "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fb": "Galileo", "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fc": "this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth", "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fd": "What we now call gravity", "573786b51c4567190057448d": "In particular, Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law.", "573786b51c4567190057448e": "the mass ( ) and the radius ( ) of the Earth", "573786b51c4567190057448f": "the mass of the attracting body", "573786b51c45671900574490": "the mass ( ) and the radius ( ) of the Earth", "5ad27e30d7d075001a429700": "Newton", "5ad27e30d7d075001a429701": "if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law", "5ad27e30d7d075001a429702": "Newton", "5ad27e30d7d075001a429703": "the mass of the attracting body", "57378862c3c5551400e51f21": "a dimensional constant", "57378862c3c5551400e51f22": "Henry Cavendish", "57378862c3c5551400e51f23": "1798", "57378862c3c5551400e51f24": "Newton", "5ad27f01d7d075001a429742": "a dimensional constant", "5ad27f01d7d075001a429743": "unknown", "5ad27f01d7d075001a429744": "Newton", "5ad27f01d7d075001a429745": "the force on a spherical object of mass due to the gravitational pull of mass", "5737898f1c45671900574495": "Mercury", "5737898f1c45671900574496": "Vulcan )", "5737898f1c45671900574497": "a correction", "5737898f1c45671900574498": "Albert Einstein", "5737898f1c45671900574499": "Albert Einstein", "5ad27fb9d7d075001a429782": "Some astrophysicists", "5ad27fb9d7d075001a429783": "Some astrophysicists", "5ad27fb9d7d075001a429784": "his theory of general relativity", "5ad27fb9d7d075001a429785": "the discrepancies", "57378b141c4567190057449f": "general relativity", "57378b141c456719005744a0": "the straight line path", "57378b141c456719005744a1": "", "57378b141c456719005744a2": "in a global sense", "5ad28035d7d075001a4297a6": "general relativity", "5ad28035d7d075001a4297a7": "gravitation", "5ad28035d7d075001a4297a8": "the straight line path in space -
